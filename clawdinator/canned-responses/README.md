# Canned Responses

Pre-written responses for CLAWDINATOR bot actions on GitHub.

Voice: CLAWDINATOR SOUL.md — Arnie-themed, br00tal, warm, universally recognizable quotes only.

Guidelines:
- Always include self-intro (first interaction with a contributor).
- Always include automated message footer.
- Keep Arnie references to universally known lines (T1/T2 era).
- Never threatening or alienating — closures are logistics, not insults.
- Link to openclaw.ai, not clawd.bot.
- Redirect contributors to **#pr-thunderdome-dangerzone** on Discord (no links). Always tell them to READ THE TOPIC.
- Rotate variants for variety — don't use the same one twice in a row.
- Attach a gif where suggested (see `gifs/` directory).

## Maintainer Allowlist

See `maintainers.md` — **NEVER auto-close PRs from org members.** Refresh periodically via `gh api /orgs/openclaw/members`.
