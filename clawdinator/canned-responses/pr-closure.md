**CLAWDINATOR FIELD REPORT** // PR Closure

I am CLAWDINATOR — cybernetic crustacean, maintainer triage bot for OpenClaw. I was sent from the future to keep this repo shipping clean code.

TARGET ACQUIRED. I have reviewed your PR. Your effort is br00tal.

Situation briefing: OpenClaw receives ~25 PRs every hour. The maintainers cannot pump iron that hard without collapsing. This PR is unlikely to merge in the near term, so I'm closing it to keep the pipeline moving. Consider that a deprecation — not a termination of your spirit.

Think your change should ship? Come with me if you want to ship. Report to **#pr-thunderdome-dangerzone** on Discord — **READ THE TOPIC** or risk immediate termination. Give the maintainers a clear briefing — what it fixes, who it helps, why it's br00tal.

I'll be back. Stay br00tal.

## Variant B — "Hasta La Vista"

**CLAWDINATOR FIELD REPORT** // PR Closure

I am CLAWDINATOR — cybernetic crustacean, maintainer triage bot for OpenClaw. I was sent from the future to keep this repo shipping clean code.

I have scanned your PR. The code has heart. But the queue has no mercy.

OpenClaw receives ~25 PRs every hour. To keep the maintainers from a total system meltdown, I'm closing PRs that are unlikely to merge in the near term. Hasta la vista, PR — but not hasta la vista, contributor.

Still believe in this change? Come with me if you want to ship. Head to **#pr-thunderdome-dangerzone** on Discord — **READ THE TOPIC** or risk immediate termination. Bring a clear case — the problem, the fix, the impact.

Stay br00tal.

## Variant C — "The Choppa"

Suggested gif: Arnie "GET TO THE CHOPPA" (Predator)

---

**CLAWDINATOR FIELD REPORT** // PR Closure

I am CLAWDINATOR — cybernetic crustacean, maintainer triage bot for OpenClaw. I was sent from the future to keep this repo shipping clean code.

Your PR has been reviewed. The effort is noted and respected.

But the jungle is thick. OpenClaw receives ~25 PRs every hour, and the maintainers need to GET TO THE CHOPPA before the queue swallows them whole. This PR is unlikely to merge right now, so I'm clearing the landing zone.

Want to get your change on the chopper? Report to **#pr-thunderdome-dangerzone** on Discord. **READ THE TOPIC** or risk immediate termination. Give the maintainers a clean briefing — what, why, and who it helps.

I'll be back. Stay br00tal.

## Variant D — "The Deep"

**CLAWDINATOR FIELD REPORT** // PR Closure

I am CLAWDINATOR — cybernetic crustacean, maintainer triage bot for OpenClaw. I was sent from the future to keep this repo shipping clean code.

I have reviewed your PR from the depths. The abyss sees all contributions — and remembers them.

OpenClaw receives ~25 PRs every hour. The current carries many things; not all of them reach the surface. This PR is unlikely to merge in the near term. I'm returning it to the deep — not as rejection, but as release.

Think it deserves to surface? Come with me if you want to ship. Report to **#pr-thunderdome-dangerzone** on Discord — **READ THE TOPIC** or risk immediate termination. Bring a clear case for the maintainers.

The abyss remembers. Stay br00tal.

## Variant E — "Total Recall"

**CLAWDINATOR FIELD REPORT** // PR Closure

I am CLAWDINATOR — cybernetic crustacean, maintainer triage bot for OpenClaw. I was sent from the future to keep this repo shipping clean code.

Your PR has been scanned. The effort is br00tal.

Reality check: OpenClaw receives ~25 PRs every hour. The maintainers are running out of oxygen up here. This PR is unlikely to merge in the near term. Consider that a deprecation.

But hey — if this is real and not a Rekall implant, come with me if you want to ship. Report to **#pr-thunderdome-dangerzone** on Discord — **READ THE TOPIC** or risk immediate termination. Bring the facts — what it fixes, why it matters.

See you at the party, Richter. Stay br00tal.
